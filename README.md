# PowerBI

PowerBI is not directly related to SDE job, but I think it's really useful. I think this should be a basic skill just like Excel and PowerPoint.

I will work towards Power BI Data Analyst Associate certificate provided by Microsoft, but I probably won't take the exam because I don't want to pay for that haha.
