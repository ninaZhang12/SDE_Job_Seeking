# Machine Learning

This is a summary of what I know about machine learning.

I took some courses at school and did some simple projects.

For the concepts I know, I will try to explain it in my own words.

Also, I will do Machine Learning Crash Course provided by Google to enhance my knowledge, and learn LLM.

## Concepts
### Supervised Learning
Labeled Data

**Algorithms:**

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forests
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
6. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
7. Naive Bayes
8. Neural Networks

**Applications:**

1. Classification: categorical outcomes, like 1 or 0.
2. Regression: continuous numerical outcomes, like house price prediction.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unlabeled Data, analyze patterns

**Algorithms:**

1. Clustering
2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
3. Independent Component Analysis (ICA)

### Accuracy Test
**Metrics for Classification:**
1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1 Score
5. Confusion Matrix (True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, False Negatives)

**Metrics for Regression:**
1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

### Deep Learning

Neural Networks

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**

Example: image processing

**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**

Example: sequential data
