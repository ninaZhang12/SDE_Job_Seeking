# SDE_Job_Seeking

This is a study plan/guide I am doing to find a SDE job.

## Background
I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Engineering, and I'm graduating in December 2024. I have experience in many coding languages, but I haven't done any review or summary on these skills.

## Approach
In this study plan, I will list all the skills I have or want to have, and then review or learn it. I hope I can update this repo everyday.

## Goal
My final goal for this study plan is getting a job as SDE.
